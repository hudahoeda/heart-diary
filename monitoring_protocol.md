# 🫀 Post-Ablation Monitoring Protocol (Blanking Period)

## 🎯 Objective
To gather consistent, comparable data on heart rhythm trends (Ectopic Burden) during the healing phase, reducing anxiety and providing actionable data for cardiology follow-ups.

## 🗓️ Monitoring Schedule (The "3-Point Check")
*Consistency is key.* Comparing a 5-minute session while relaxed to a 10-minute session after coffee will confuse the data. Stick to this routine:

### 1. 🌅 Morning Baseline (The "Standard")
*   **When:** Shortly after waking up, before coffee/meds, and before starting work.
*   **Duration:** **10 minutes**.
*   **Position:** Seated comfortably or lying down (supine). Stay relatively still.
*   **Why:** This is your "cleanest" data. It removes variables like stress, caffeine, and digestion. It is the best metric for your long-term healing trend.

### 2. 🌇 Evening/Symptomatic Check (The "Variable")
*   **When:** In the evening (e.g., after dinner) OR whenever you feel highly symptomatic.
*   **Duration:** **10 - 15 minutes**.
*   **Position:** Relaxed (e.g., watching TV).
*   **Why:** Arrhythmias often fluctuate with vagal tone (digestion/rest). This captures your "daily load" and helps validate symptoms.

### 3. 🏃‍♂️ Activity Check (Optional / Weekly)
*   **When:** During a light walk or permitted activity.
*   **Duration:** **15 minutes**.
*   **Why:** To check "Rate Response" – does your heart rate go up smoothly? Do ectopics disappear with higher heart rate? (A good sign of benign ectopy).

## 📋 Pre-Recording Checklist
1.  **Moisture:** Ensure the Polar H10 strap electrodes are **wet**. (Water or electrode gel is best). Dry contacts cause noise that looks like PVCs.
2.  **Tightness:** The strap should be snug but not constricting. It should not slide when you breathe deep.
3.  **Phone Mode:** Put your phone in "Do Not Disturb" to ensure the Bluetooth stream isn't interrupted by calls (which can cause data gaps).
4.  **Posture:**
    *   Sit up straight or lie flat.
    *   **Do not slouch** (compressing the chest can create artifacts).
    *   Rest your hands on your lap (don't use your phone/type during the baseline recording).

## 📲 During Recording
1.  **Relax:** Breathe normally. Don't "watch" the graph intently (biofeedback can sometimes induce anxiety/heart rate changes).
2.  **Symptom Markers:**
    *   If you feel a specific "thud", "skip", or "flutter":
    *   **Tap the Marker** button immediately.
    *   *Mental Note:* "I marked it. The report will tell me the truth."

## 📊 Weekly Review (The "Trend Analysis")
*Don't analyze every single beat every single day.* Look for the **Weekly Trend**.

*   [ ] **Burden Trend:** Is the `% Ectopic Burden` generally lower this week than last week?
*   [ ] **Rest vs. Active:** Are ectopics happening mostly at rest? (Common and usually benign).
*   [ ] **Symptom Match:** Did the "Markers" align with actual events on the graph?
    *   *Match:* Validated symptom.
    *   *No Match:* "Phantom" sensation (Nerve healing).

## 🚨 When to Call the Doctor
*   **High Burden:** Consistent burden > 10-15% over multiple readings.
*   **Symptoms:** Syncope (fainting), severe shortness of breath, or chest pain.
*   **AFib Warning:** If the report consistently shows "Irregularly Irregular" patterns with high heart rate, or if you feel a "fish flopping" sensation that doesn't stop.
